#Youâ€™ve been asked to evaluate a proposal for a new dam to be
#built along a remote river that is currently used for subsistence fisheries.
#Construction is expected to cost $10M in the first year (pretend this is a fast build),
#with additional operating costs of $100K/year over the following 19 years.
#It is expected that this dam will generate electricity worth
#$1M/year starting in year 3 increasing by 2% per year from then on due to higher expected demand
#Proponents have also indicated an additional $50K/year from local fishing
#tourism starting in year 5 when the new lake is stable and fully stocked with fish.
#The planning and public consultation process is in very early stages,
#so there is a lot of uncertainty about what discount rate and
#decision rule to use for the project. The main questions are:

#####Part 1 ######

#1. What is the NPV and BCR of the project at a 3, 5, 10, and 20% discount rate?
#Question 1

#####Part 2#### -> COMPLETED IN EXCEL FILE
#What are other costs and benefits that we could consider
#as part of this project? Build a MATA table and include 
#a qualitative impact scale to help convey this.

#######Part 3 ########## -> completed in comment on file submission 
#Based on the table from the previous questions, 
#which includes both quantitative (e.g., NPV, BCR)
# and qualitative impacts, write a short paragraph to
# convince someone that 1) this project should be built,
# and 2) this project should not be built.
